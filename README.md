# Atomic Clock Check

[Atomic Clock Check](https://jamesmikesell.github.io/atomicTimeCheck/)  is an app for capturing and recording the exact instance an event occurred.  To ensure measured times are accurate even when spaced over several days, the displayed and captured times are compensated against an [NTP synchronized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) time server, and adjusted for network delays.

Atomic Clock Check was developed to monitor time drift of mechanical time pieces over several days, however Atomic Clock Check can be used anywhere accurate time measurements are necessary.
